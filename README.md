Last month, our friends group met up in San Francisco for a two week trip ✈️🌉 Exploring the park, walking on the beach, soaking in the sights and sounds of the neighborhood… There were so many beautiful moments that we wanted to cherish, ones that we wanted to remember even after we said goodbye. Hence, Flashback was born!  🎇Flashback was conceptualised based on our personal experiences – an expression of friendship between creative souls, a place to store all the wonderful memories we made 💌, in a style that’s unmistakably us.
To create an app that feels both human and true to ourselves, we hand drew all of the landing page and avatar icons, based on cozy and cute aesthetics we both love 🌷💖The interface is simple and intuitive, so that your memories take centre stage.
